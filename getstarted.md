<h1>Overview</h1>

There are multiple ways to get mlpack up and running. Python bindings can be installed using pip or conda, or built from source (see "Build from source" tutorials).
For C++, if mlpack is not available via your preferred OS package manager, or if you need to build your own version (e.g. to apply optimizations, use a different 
set of BLAS/LAPACK, or build a different configuration), please refer to the "Build from source" tutorials.
For Windows, prebuilt binaries will help you get started without the need of building mlpack. These packages include both the C++ mlpack library as well as the CLI tools.

Here is a summary of the currently available distribution options you can use depending on your needs:
