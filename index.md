description: mlpack | fast, flexible machine learning library in C++
order: 1
---
mlpack is a fast, flexible machine learning library, written in C++, that aims
to provide fast, extensible implementations of cutting-edge machine learning
algorithms. mlpack provides these algorithms as simple command-line programs,
Python bindings, and C++ classes which can then be integrated into larger-scale
machine learning solutions.

mlpack is written in C++ and built on the
[Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net) linear algebra library, the
[ensmallen](https://www.ensmallen.org) function optimization library, and parts
of [Boost](https://boost.org).
